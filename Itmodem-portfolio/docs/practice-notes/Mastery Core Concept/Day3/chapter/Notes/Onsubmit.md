Certainly! The code you've shared is a part of a **React functional component** that handles a basic form submission. Here's a line-by-line explanation with comments:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevents the default form submission behavior (which reloads the page)
  alert(`Submitted name: ${name}`); // Displays an alert with the current value of 'name'
};
```

This function is triggered when the form is submitted. It stops the page from reloading and shows an alert with the submitted name.

```jsx
return (
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> {/* The form's submit event is handled by handleSubmit */}
    <input
      type="text"
      value={name} // The value of the input field is bound to the 'name' variable (likely from useState)
      onChange={handleChange} // Updates the 'name' variable when the user types something
    />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button> {/* Submits the form */}
  </form>
);
```

### Additional Context (likely needed for full understanding):

Although it's not shown in your snippet, this component assumes:

* There's a `useState` hook defined like:

  ```jsx
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  ```
* And a `handleChange` function defined like:

  ```jsx
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setName(e.target.value); // Updates 'name' with the value from the input field
  };
  ```

### Summary:

This React component:

1. Displays a form with a text input and submit button.
2. Captures user input into a `name` state.
3. On submission, prevents page reload and shows an alert with the input value.
