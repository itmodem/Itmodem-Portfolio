Great question! Understanding the word **“Mount”** is key in React (and any UI framework).

---

## 📌 **What is "Mount" in React?**

> “Mount” means **adding a component to the screen (DOM)** for the first time.

---

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

* When your component **first appears** in the browser — it's **mounted**.
* React calls this process: **Mounting Phase**.

## 🔄 React Lifecycle (Function Components)

| Phase          | Meaning                                     | useEffect Usage                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 **Mount**   | First time component is added to DOM        | `useEffect(() => {}, [])`               |
| 🟡 **Update**  | Component updates due to props/state change | `useEffect(() => {}, [dep])`            |
| 🔴 **Unmount** | Component removed from DOM                  | `return () => { ... }` inside useEffect |

---

### ✅ Example:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted"); // Only once
  }, []);

  return <h2>Welcome!</h2>;
}
```

When `<Welcome />` is **added to screen**, it is **mounted**.

## 🧩 Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine your component is a **TV**:

* 🟢 **Mount** → Plug TV into the wall and turn it ON for the first time.
* 🟡 **Update** → Change volume or channel (but TV is still on).
* 🔴 **Unmount** → Turn TV off and unplug.
